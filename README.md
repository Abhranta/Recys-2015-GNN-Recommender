# Recys-2015-GNN-Recommender
This is a repository with a GNN based recommender system for ReCys 2015 challenge

In this repository, I have created a custom GNN with SAGEConv layer used for binary classification.I have used Pytorch Geometric to build and train the layers. there are two tasks that I have solved here:
<ul>
  <li> Predict whether there will be a buy event followed by a sequence of clicks </li>
  <li> Predict which item will be bought </li>
  </ul>
